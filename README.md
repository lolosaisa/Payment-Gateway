# Cross-Chain Payment Gateway

A cross-chain payment gateway that enables seamless transactions between **M-Pesa** and various blockchain solutions. This project is designed to bridge traditional mobile payment systems like M-Pesa with modern blockchain ecosystems, allowing secure, fast, and interoperable financial transactions.

## Features

- **M-Pesa Integration**: Facilitate payments using the M-Pesa mobile money service.
- **Blockchain Support**: Seamless integration with popular blockchain platforms (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, etc.).
- **Cross-Chain Payments**: Transfer funds across chains, ensuring compatibility between traditional and decentralized financial systems.
- **Secure Transactions**: All transactions are protected through encryption and blockchain's inherent security features.
- **Transaction Monitoring**: View and monitor payment statuses and histories in real-time.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js (Express) / Django (Python) — for handling payment processing and API integration.
- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS — for creating the user interface.
- **Blockchain**: Integration with [Ethereum], [Solana], [Binance Smart Chain], and other blockchains.
- **Mobile Payments**: Integration with the **M-Pesa API**.
- **Database**: MongoDB / PostgreSQL — for storing transaction details.
